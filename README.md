# vsphere-ansible-lab-builder
Build a nested vSphere lab with Ansible

## Description
You can use the ansible playbooks in this repo to build out nested ESXi hosts, deploy a vCenter and configure clusters. ESXi/vCenter 6.7 and 7.0 are supported. The main design goal of this project is to be able to provide both opinionated deployment with few variables and to have the ability to fully customize the deployment.

## Dependencies
Infrastructure:
- A machine which is able to run docker that also has access to where the VMs will be deployed.
- A licensed vSphere cluster.
- A datastore to host VMs of at least 200GB.
- An NTP server which is reachable by IP.
- All port groups assigned to ESXi host which are in tern used by VMs should have promiscuous or [Mac Learning](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2018/04/native-mac-learning-in-vsphere-6-7-removes-the-need-for-promiscuous-mode-for-nested-esxi.html) enabled on the parent port group.
Software downloads should be placed in a single directory:
- [ESXi OVA images](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/nested-virtualization/nested-esxi-virtual-appliance)
- [vCenter ISO](https://my.vmware.com/en/group/vmware/downloads/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/7_0)

### Tested versions
This release has been tested with the following components:
vSphere - 7.0.2
ESXi nested OVA - 7.0U2
NSX-T - 3.1.1

## Usage 
Each deployment pattern has an opinionated and a custom example. The idea of the opinionated deployment is that the user has to proide the minimum of configuration and the remainder of the options are calculated from this. Whereas the custom example has to have all sections built up by hand. Either of the examples types can be fully customized.<br/>

You must export the credentials to you existing vCenter as environmental variables along with the path on your local machine which contains the software listed above.
```
export PARENT_VCENTER_USERNAME="administrator@vsphere.local"
export PARENT_VCENTER_PASSWORD="VMware1!"
export SOFTWARE_DIR="$HOME/Downloads/vmware-products" 
```

### Docker Usage 
After cloning the repo, you should make a copy and update the relevant vars yaml from the var-examples directory, making sure to include your ova and iso file names, and to change any IP addresses and credentials.<br/>
Check the readme file in the example directory for any additional steps which may be needed for that solution.<br/>

The example below will deploy a single host and a vCenter, plus create a cluster with the minimum feature set. It should be run from the root of this repo and will copy the repo in as `/work`.
```
docker run --rm \
    --env PARENT_VCENTER_USERNAME=${PARENT_VCENTER_USERNAME} \
    --env PARENT_VCENTER_PASSWORD=${PARENT_VCENTER_PASSWORD} \
    --env SOFTWARE_DIR='/software_dir' \
    --env ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR='true' \
    --env NSXT_LICENSE_KEY=${NSXT_LICENSE_KEY:-na} \
    --volume ${SOFTWARE_DIR}:/software_dir \
    --volume ${PWD}:/work \
    laidbackware/vsphere-ansible:v2 \
    ansible-playbook /work/deploy.yml \
        --extra-vars '@/work/var-examples/base-vsphere/minimal-opinionated.yml'
```

### Destroying
To destroy use destroy.yml. E.g. `ansible-playbook destroy.yml --extra-vars="@var-examples/vsphere-base/1host-minimal-opinionated.yml"`

## Troubleshooting
The vCenter install can take a long time. You can check the progress by browsing to https://<vcenter IP>:5480. If the vCenter install fails, check the `vcsa-cli-installer.log` file which can be found in a created directory under /tmp.<br/>
To debug in docker, first enter the container with bash, then run the playbook. This way the vCenter build logs will be avaible after the failure.
```
# This command will start a bash shell within the container
docker run  -it --rm \
    --env PARENT_VCENTER_USERNAME=${PARENT_VCENTER_USERNAME} \
    --env PARENT_VCENTER_PASSWORD=${PARENT_VCENTER_PASSWORD} \
    --env SOFTWARE_DIR='/software_dir' \
    --env ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR='true' \
    --env NSXT_LICENSE_KEY=${NSXT_LICENSE_KEY} \
    --volume ${SOFTWARE_DIR}:/software_dir \
    --volume ${PWD}:/work \
    laidbackware/vsphere-ansible:v2 \
    /bin/bash

# Then the playbook can be triggered
ansible-playbook /work/deploy.yml --extra-vars '@/work/<path>/<file>.yml'
```
If adding new variables to the vars file be sure to only use underscores as variable names and not hyphens.

## Roadmap
For solution specifc features, check the relevant example directory.
- Add ability to create TKGS namespaces
- Add ability to deploy TKGS embedded Harbor
- Add ability to create guest clusters for TKGS
- Add ability to deploy VMs to folders and resource pools on parent VC
- Add NFS server creation via Ubuntu VM
- Add more examples for different topologies
- Add support for VSAN configuration


## Docker Image Build
From the root of the repo. Note no-cache flag used to force builds to pickup any changes to the git repos.
```
docker build --no-cache ./docker/. -t laidbackware/vsphere-ansible:v2
```

## Local Usage
At the current time it's advised against trying to run locally as modifications are needed to the vSphere community modules, which have pull requests pending.<br/>
After cloneing the repo, you must update the relevant vars file yaml to point to your ova and iso file, plus change any IP addresses or credentials.<br/>

Software dependencies for Linux:
- Ansible 2.10 or higher
- Linux tools `apt-get install libarchive-tools sshpass python3-pip git python3-jmespath sshpass`
- Python modules `pip3 install pyvmomi ansible==2.10.* netaddr`
- Install [vSphere Automation SDK](https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python)
    `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`
    `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python.git`
- Add vmware modules from Ansible Galaxy `ansible-galaxy collection install community.vmware:1.8.0`

### Cloning repos for the extra modules
You will need to use git to clone ansible-for-nsxt and ansible-for-vsphere-tanzu, then export the location of the modules. A specific branch will be cloned for ansible-for-nsxt as it contains a necessary fix which has a pull request pending. Below assumes a directory called workspace to host the modules.
```
cd $HOME/workspace
git clone https://github.com/vmware/ansible-for-nsxt.git
git clone https://github.com/laidbackware/ansible-for-vsphere-tanzu.git
export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=$HOME/workspace/ansible-for-nsxt:$HOME/workspace/ansible-for-vsphere-tanzu
export ANSIBLE_MODULE_UTILS=$HOME/workspace/ansible-for-nsxt/module_utils
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
```
It is recommended to use direnv and have the above export commands in a .envrc file.<br/>
Once all is setup run the playbooks can be run locally:
```
ansible-playbook deploy.yml --extra-vars="@var-examples/base-vsphere/1host-minimal-opinionated.yml"
```
